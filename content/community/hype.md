- [@webyeti](https://twitter.com/webyeti)'s [**Building a Pwnagotchi - Pwning wifi with AI**](https://www.webyeti.ninja/blog/building-a-pwnagotchi-pwning-wifi-with-ai) [2019-10-07]: **Please note:** Many of the steps for installing Pwnagotchi are now out of date in this walkthrough; for the most up-to-date installation instructions, always refer to our official [Installation](../installation/) doc. The rest is still solid, though. :)

<!-- §CHANGE§ i just threw these together; dunno if you want to reorder or add different ones, but it seems nice to give a nod to all the community involvement & engagement - i just wanted to move the community-submitted blogs and some of the review tweets out of the `Hacks` doc -->
