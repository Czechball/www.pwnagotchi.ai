This project has two main groups of REST API depending if you want to interact with the grid or just your unit.

The first group, the [grid API](/api/grid/), is that set of API that will allow you to communicate with this server for tasks 
such as checking your [PwnMail](/usage/#pwnmail), having a list of registered units, reporting a new access point, and so on.

The second instead, the [local API](/api/local/), is available locally on each single unit and will allow you to interact with
the WiFi advertisement protocol.
